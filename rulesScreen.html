        Rules of the Game: <br>
        <br>
        Click on objects to interact with them. Some objects can be placed in your inventory for later use. The objects 
        can also interact with your environment. To do this, first click on the object in your inventory, and then on 
        the environment. For example, if you have a key in your inventory, you can select it and then click on a door
        to unlock it. <br>
        <br>
        Each character has a different set of skills, which allows them to interact with the environment in different ways.
        Each character should be able to complete each room, but be aware that you may miss things that another 
        character could catch. <br>
        <br>
        For level one, you can only use one character. In future levels, you can switch between them.
