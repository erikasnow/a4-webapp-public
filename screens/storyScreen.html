    <p>Mr. Hyde died a week ago. He was an old man who lived in a mansion on the hill overlooking your town.
        You don't know much about him, but there was one time where you saw him at the local library. After politely
        saying hello, you went to grab a book you needed for school. You couldn't shake the feeling that he was
        watching you the whole time. He gave you the creeps.
    </p>
    <p>You and your three best friends sometimes discussed the rumors about Mr. Hyde. Some people in town thought he
        was a murderer. Others thought he was a surgeon who'd retired after a horrible mishap on the operating table.
        Some say it wasn't a mishap at all. But no matter what you thought about Mr. Hyde, there was one undeniable
        fact. He was filthy rich.
    </p>
    <p>You and your friends know that there's treasure buried somewhere in that mansion. So you decide to search for it
        the first opportunity you get. Tonight.
    </p>
    <p>As you crest the hill, you look for your friends at the rendevoux point. No one is there. You were running a bit
        late in getting here, so you figure they're already inside the house. However, when you try to open the door,
        you find it locked. You'll need to find a way into the house if you want a slice of that treasure...
